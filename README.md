## Presenting ##
The presentation is written in LaTeX, and by default, all non-LaTeX files are ignored.  When a new version of the pdfs is
desired, you must force git to add them.  New PDFs can be generated by using latexmk, nothing but a standard TeX distribution
is required to build the pdf.

You can use any pdf viewer which has a "presentation mode" to present.  If you don't normally use pdfs to give presentations,
I suggest using the Firefox browser.

You can generate a handout with the included shell scripts.
